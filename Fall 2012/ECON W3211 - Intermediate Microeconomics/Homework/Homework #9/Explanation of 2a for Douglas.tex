\textit{Illustrate in a diagram the market clearing price and quantity traded after the government subsidizes education.}\\\\

\includegraphics[height=4in]{Charts/2a} \\\\

\textit{Indicate in your diagram the net price paid by students (tuition less the grant) and the total price received by the colleges.}\\\\

The net price paid by students is $P_S$. The total price received by the colleges is  $P_C$.

\textit{Continuing into 2b:}\\\\\

\begin{align}
	\textnormal{Initial producer surplus: } {PS}_0 &= \textbf{\textcolor{Purple}{PURPLE} + \textcolor{Orange}{ORANGE}} \\
	\textnormal{Initial consumer surplus: } {CS}_0 &= \textbf{\textcolor{Yellow}{YELLOW} + \textcolor{NavyBlue}{BLUE}} \\
	\textnormal{Post-subsidy producer surplus: } {PS}^{'} &=\textbf{\textcolor{Purple}{PURPLE} + \textcolor{Orange}{ORANGE} + \textcolor{NavyBlue}{BLUE} + \textcolor{Magenta}{MAGENTA}} \\
	\textnormal{Post-subsidy consumer surplus: } {CS}^{'} &=\textbf{\textcolor{Yellow}{YELLOW} + \textcolor{NavyBlue}{BLUE} + \textcolor{Orange}{ORANGE} + \textcolor{Green}{GREEN} + \textcolor{Cyan}{CYAN}} \\
	\textnormal{Government spending: } GS &= \textbf{ \textcolor{NavyBlue}{BLUE} + \textcolor{Magenta}{MAGENTA} + \textcolor{Orange}{ORANGE} + \textcolor{Green}{GREEN} + \textcolor{Cyan}{CYAN} + \textcolor{Red}{RED}} \\
	\textnormal{Deadweight loss: } DWL &= \textbf{\textcolor{Red}{RED}}
\end{align}


We can see that the \textbf{\textcolor{Red}{RED}} region represents deadweight loss. It is part of government spending $(GS = Q^{*^{'}}[P_C - P_S])$ yet does not factor into either consumer or producer surplus. The \textbf{\textcolor{Red}{RED}} region, with area $\frac{1}{2} ( Q^{*^{'}} - Q^*)(P_C-P_S)$ represents money that was spent and essentially disappears, generating no surplus, i.e. deadweight loss.

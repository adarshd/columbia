Columbia
========

This repo contains all of my classwork from Columbia. I dropped out after my sophomore year to work on [Valet.io](http://valet.io). You can [read more about that on my blog](http://www.bendrucker.me/). I'm a strong believer in [open and free information](http://www.bendrucker.me/posts/the-open-default-principle/) and was disappointed to find that large universities don't feel the same.
